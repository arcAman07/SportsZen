# SportZen ⛓⚽️♜

## Abstract

There are many unpopular sports in India whose players are unrecognized or rather underrated. The players of these sports like chess, football, table-tennis keep working hard but still do not get the recognition they deserve.  What if we can help them by connecting their abilities with new-age tech? 

## Idea

In order to bring in more recognition and to make such things mainstream, we are  taking some important moments from the games played by players/teams and take certain moments and make NFTs of those situations.

For example: Let us take a chess game, between 2 players, we will capture some moments and put them up for voting on the marketplace. Common users like us can compete to vote for the best NFT in an auction from where users can put bids on the various available NFT's and the highest bidder will own that NFT.

Not just this, we are also planning to have an AR integration of the purchased NFT. Since NFT's are digital assets, we are providing an almost real world experience of the owned NFT.

## Novelty

Augmented Reality being used to give a virtual experience of a Non-Fungible Token in our preferred surroundings. This feature is similar to preview for products in an e commerce store, but has not been tried before with blockchain.

## Business Model

The main purpose of this decentralized application is to promote unpopular sports and under-rated players (in the field of sports) in India. As we have seen currently popular blockchain based companies like Polygon, CoinDCX,etc are taking a step forward to promote unpopular sports like Chess, Football, etc in India and this has created a wave. We would love to collaborate with these companies for our decentralized application “Sports-Zen” and do our best in any way possible. Through the blockchain transaction a part of the transaction will go for the upliftment of the sport in India ( a part of the transaction will be ledgered to our decentralised application apart from gas fees ) and then the rest to the admin who put the NFT up for sale. Along with the use of AR and future implementation of VR we try to take this to a whole new level and bring about a change in the sports fraternity not only in India but around the world with this application.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced multiple challenges while developing this project

- Integrating the smart contracts with the frontend
- AR view of the owned digital asset
- Setting up metamask
- Connecting metamask to localhost

## Features

- View list of Assets created

- Buy an asset

- Create an asset

- Augmented Reality experience of the owned asset

- LeaderBoard

## Future Scope

- A virtual reality based auction where users can experience a meta verse like auction(Auction in the future)
- Collaboration with upcoming blockchain companies such as Polygon and CoinDCX who are working actively to uplift the development of underrated players and sports. 
- A decentralized autonomous organization(which is the talk of the town), where everyone will have a say in the growth of the organization.
